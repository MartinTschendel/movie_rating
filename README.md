Trained different classifiers (Naive Bayes, Deep Learning, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN) and assessed their performance of different classifiers by applying the following metrics:

Confusion Matrix
Accuracy (how many of the predicted results are similar to the test set results)
Precision ï¼ˆmeasuring exactness; when the model predicts yes, how often is it correct?)
Recall (measuring completeness; when it's actually yes, how often does it predict yes?)
F1 Score (compromise between Precision and Recall)
calculation time
--> Saved the results within a dataframe and export it to a csv
